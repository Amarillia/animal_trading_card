			<p class="descr"> It is listed as endangered, in 2003, the size of the global population was estimated at 4,080â€“6,590 adults. Snow leopards are slightly smaller than the other big cats but, like them, exhibit a range of sizes, generally weighing between 27 and 55 kg (60 and 121 lb). They have a relatively short body, measuring in length from the head to the base of the tail 75 to 150 cm (30 to 60 in). However, the tail is quite long, at 80 to 100 cm (31 to 39 in).
			<br />Snow leopards have long, thick fur, and their base color varies from smoky gray to yellowish tan, with whitish underparts. They have dark grey to black open rosettes on their bodies, with small spots of the same color on their heads and larger spots on their legs and tails. Unusually among cats, their eyes are pale green or grey in color.
			<br /> Snow leopards show several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environment. The snow leopard cannot roar, despite possessing partial ossification of the hyoid bone.
